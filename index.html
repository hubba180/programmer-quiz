      <p class="panel panel-body">Many aspiring programmers find it hard to choose from the seemingly endless list of programming languages and while it might be nice to hear that most programming concepts carry over from language to language, that doesn't always make it easier when choosing one to learn. Fortunately for you, this tool has been created to be an aid in your programming quest to learn the best language. Below you will take a short quiz where you will enter some basic information about yourself. Then, we will process your answers to generate what we think will be the best language for you.<br><br> May the Force be with you!</p>
